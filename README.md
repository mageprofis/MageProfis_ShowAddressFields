Description
------------
Ever wanted your customers to register with more than an email and password combination? Magento has you covered, well, almost. This module adds a configuration option in the Magento backend and all you have to do is flick a switch and your customers can enter their address data on registration.

Requirements
------------
- PHP >= 5.3.0

Compatibility
--------------
- Magento >= 1.7

Installation
-----------------------
You can use this module the old-fashioned way and upload all files from the `./src` folder to your webroot (where your Magento installation sits).

Or you can be smart and use modman. And since you're smart I won't have to explain what [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) is or how you can use it, you already know.
